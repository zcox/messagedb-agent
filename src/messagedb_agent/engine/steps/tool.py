"""Tool step execution for the processing engine.

This module implements the tool step, which:
1. Projects events to extract tool calls from the last LLM response
2. For each tool call:
   - Writes ToolExecutionRequested event
   - Checks if tool requires approval based on permission level
   - If approval required and not auto-approve mode:
     - Writes approval/rejection event (based on config for now)
   - Executes the tool if approved
   - Writes ToolExecutionCompleted or ToolExecutionFailed event
3. Returns overall success status

The tool step is one of the three core step types in the processing loop.
