This provides users with explicit control over what tools the agent can execute.\n\n### What Was Completed:\n\n1. **TUI Approval Modal** (`src/messagedb_agent/tui/approval_modal.py`):\n   - Beautiful modal dialog showing tool name, arguments (formatted JSON), and permission level\n   - Keyboard shortcuts: y (approve), n (reject), escape (reject)\n   - Approve/Reject buttons with color-coded variants\n   - Responsive design with scrollable arguments area\n\n2. **TUI Integration** (`src/messagedb_agent/tui/app.py`):\n   - Event watching for ToolExecutionRequested events\n   - Automatic approval modal display for tools requiring approval\n   - Safe tools (like get_current_time, echo, calculate) execute without prompts\n   - Approval/rejection events written to event stream based on user choice\n   - Changed auto_approve_tools from True to False for manual approval mode\n\n3. **Processing Loop Updates** (`src/messagedb_agent/engine/steps/tool.py`):\n   - Polling mechanism that waits for ToolExecutionApproved or ToolExecutionRejected events\n   - 5-minute timeout with automatic rejection if no response\n   - Graceful handling of rejected tools (writes ToolExecutionFailed event)\n   - Matches approval events to tool calls by tool_id or tool_name\n\n4. **Demo Tool** (`src/messagedb_agent/tools/builtin.py`):\n   - Added write_note() tool with REQUIRES_APPROVAL permission level\n   - Demonstrates the approval system in action\n   - All existing tools explicitly marked as SAFE\n\n5. **Tests**:\n   - Updated tests for new tool count (4 instead of 3)\n   - All 694 tests passing\n   - Linting and type checking clean\n\n### How It Works:\n\n1. LLM requests a tool execution\n2. Processing loop writes ToolExecutionRequested event\n3. TUI subscriber receives the event\n4. If tool requires approval, TUI shows modal to user\n5. User clicks Approve or Reject (or uses keyboard shortcuts)\n6. TUI writes ToolExecutionApproved or ToolExecutionRejected event\n7. Processing loop polls for the approval event\n8. If approved, tool executes normally\n9. If rejected, ToolExecutionFailed event is written and LLM is informed\n\n### Event Sourcing Benefits:\n\n- All approval decisions are recorded in the event stream\n- Complete audit trail of what was approved/rejected and by whom\n- Can replay sessions to see exactly what happened\n- Non-blocking async flow in TUI (user can interact while processing)\n\n### Testing Recommendations:\n\n1. Start TUI: `uv run python -m messagedb_agent.tui`\n2. Ask LLM to write a note: \"Please write a note that says 'Testing approval system'\"\n3. Approval modal should appear\n4. Test both approve and reject flows\n5. Verify safe tools like \"what time is it?\" work without prompts\n\nCommit: a64f459f11740dc9c1776f4602a18d0b01519547","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"Claude","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:17:31.055811-06:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T18:05:24.391184-06:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T18:05:24.391184-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"messagedb-agent-92","depends_on_id":"messagedb-agent-81","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:17:31.057049-06:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"messagedb-agent-92","depends_on_id":"messagedb-agent-87","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:17:37.041428-06:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Extend the tool framework to allow tools to write additional events to the stream:\n\n- Add optional `stream_name` and `store_client` parameters to tool execution context\n- Tools can write events using `write_event(store_client, stream_name, event_type, data)`\n- Tool execution records both the return value AND any events written\n- Events written by tools are part of the permanent conversation history\n\n**Example: Todo List Tool**\n\nImplement a reference implementation that demonstrates the pattern:\n\n```python\n@tool(name=\"todo_add\", description=\"Add item to todo list\")\ndef todo_add(task: str, priority: str = \"medium\", \n             stream_name: str = None, store_client = None):\n    # Write custom event to stream\n    if stream_name and store_client:\n        write_event(\n            store_client,\n            stream_name,\n            event_type=\"TodoItemAdded\",\n            data={\n                \"task\": task,\n                \"priority\": priority,\n                \"status\": \"open\",\n                \"added_at\": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()\n            }\n        )\n    return f\"Added todo: {task}\"\n\n@tool(name=\"todo_complete\")\ndef todo_complete(task_id: int, stream_name: str = None, store_client = None):\n    if stream_name and store_client:\n        write_event(\n            store_client,\n            stream_name,\n            event_type=\"TodoItemCompleted\",\n            data={\n                \"task_id\": task_id,\n                \"completed_at\": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()\n            }\n        )\n    return f\"Completed todo #{task_id}\"\n```\n\n**Todo List Pane (Example Projection)**\n\nCreate a pane that projects TodoItemAdded/TodoItemCompleted events:\n\n- Shows current todo list state\n- Filters events to show only todo-related events\n- Displays: task description, priority, status, timestamps\n- Updates in real-time as agent adds/completes tasks\n- Visual indicators (checkboxes, colors for priority)\n- Shows completed items (crossed out or separate section)\n\n**Projection Function:**\n\n```python\ndef project_to_todo_list(events):\n    todos = {}\n    next_id = 1\n    \n    for event in events:\n        if event.type == \"TodoItemAdded\":\n            todos[next_id] = {\n                \"id\": next_id,\n                \"task\": event.data[\"task\"],\n                \"priority\": event.data[\"priority\"],\n                \"status\": \"open\",\n                \"added_at\": event.data[\"added_at\"]\n            }\n            next_id += 1\n        elif event.type == \"TodoItemCompleted\":\n            task_id = event.data[\"task_id\"]\n            if task_id in todos:\n                todos[task_id][\"status\"] = \"completed\"\n                todos[task_id][\"completed_at\"] = event.data[\"completed_at\"]\n    \n    return sorted(todos.values(), key=lambda x: x[\"id\"])\n```\n\n**Additional Tool Ideas:**\n\nOther tools that could write custom events:\n- **Code Editor Tool**: Writes FileModified/FileCreated events\n- **Web Search Tool**: Writes SearchResultFound events  \n- **Database Query Tool**: Writes QueryExecuted events\n- **Timer/Reminder Tool**: Writes ReminderScheduled events\n- **Note Taking Tool**: Writes NoteAdded events\n- **Diagram Tool**: Writes DiagramNodeAdded/DiagramEdgeAdded events\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n- Update `execute_tool()` to pass stream context to tools\n- Tools declare if they need stream access via metadata\n- Only pass stream context to tools that request it (security)\n- Record which events were written by which tool (metadata)\n- TUI can dynamically show/hide panes based on event types present\n- Auto-detect specialized event types and suggest relevant panes\n\n**Advanced Features:**\n\n- Pane registry: tools can register their own pane types\n- Dynamic pane loading: if TodoItemAdded events detected, offer to show Todo pane\n- Cross-thread todo lists: aggregate todos across multiple sessions\n- Export projections: save todo list as markdown/JSON\n- Event-driven workflows: TodoItemAdded triggers reminder tool","design":"**Architectural Significance:**\n\nThis is a powerful pattern that transforms tools from simple input→output functions into **participants in the event-sourced conversation**.

By the time the loop exits, accumulated_events is missing all the events that were written during processing.\n\n**Proposed solution: Incremental read**\n```python\n# Step 5: Read any remaining events since last read and project complete state\nfinal_messages = read_stream(store_client, stream_name, position=last_position + 1)\nif final_messages:\n    final_events = [_message_to_event(msg) for msg in final_messages]\n    accumulated_events.extend(final_events)\nfinal_state = project_to_session_state(accumulated_events)\n```\n\nThis only reads new events written since the last position (which includes events written by execute_llm_step and execute_tool_step in the final iteration), avoiding the full stream re-read from position 0.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"chore","assignee":"Claude","created_at":"2025-10-29T13:42:46.377242-06:00","updated_at":"2025-10-29T13:48:53.691035-06:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T13:48:53.691035-06:00","labels":["optimization","performance"]}
{"id":"messagedb-agent-97","title":"Add optimistic concurrency control to event writes in processing loop","description":"The processing loop in src/messagedb_agent/engine/loop.py:217 calls execute_tool_step and execute_llm_step which write events to Message DB.
