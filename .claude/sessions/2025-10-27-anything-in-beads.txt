> anything in beads? 

⏺ I'll check what issues are currently tracked in beads for this project.

⏺ plugin:beads:beads - list (MCP)(workspace_root: "/Users/ZCox/code/zcox/messagedb-agent")
  ⎿  {             
       "result": []
     }

⏺ No issues are currently tracked in beads. The issue tracker is initialized but empty. Would you like to create some
   issues to track the remaining implementation tasks from your roadmap (like Phase 3: Event type definitions, Phase
  4: Projection framework, etc.)?

> read @tasks.md and for each Task in Phase 1, add it to the beads tracker. if it's marked as done in tasks.md then 
mark it as closed in beads. 
  ⎿  Read tasks.md (1015 lines)

⏺ I'll read the tasks.md file and create beads issues for each Phase 1 task, marking completed ones as closed.

⏺ Now I'll close these three issues since they are marked as complete in tasks.md:

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully added all Phase 1 tasks to the beads tracker:

  Created and closed (all tasks complete):
  - messagedb-agent-1: Initialize Python project with uv ✓
  - messagedb-agent-2: Define project structure ✓
  - messagedb-agent-3: Add core dependencies ✓

  All three Phase 1 tasks from tasks.md are now tracked in beads and marked as closed since they were already
  completed. You can verify this by running /beads:list or checking the .beads/ directory.

> /beads:list is running… 

⏺ I can see the /beads:list command is running. Let me wait for it to complete and show you the results.

⏺ plugin:beads:beads - list (MCP)(workspace_root: "/Users/ZCox/code/zcox/messagedb-agent")
  ⎿  {                             
       "result": [
         {
     … +63 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Great! The beads list shows all 3 Phase 1 tasks have been successfully added and closed:

  Closed Tasks (Phase 1 - Complete):
  1. messagedb-agent-1: Initialize Python project with uv
  2. messagedb-agent-2: Define project structure
  3. messagedb-agent-3: Add core dependencies

  All tasks are marked as closed with task type and medium priority (2). They were created and closed on 2025-10-27.

  Would you like me to continue adding the remaining phases from tasks.md to beads? Based on the progress tracking in
   tasks.md, there are 33 completed tasks total and 51 remaining tasks across Phases 2-13.

> actually now update the tasks in Phase 1 of tasks.md with their beads issue ID, so we can cross-reference them. 

⏺ I'll update the tasks.md file to add the beads issue IDs to each Phase 1 task.

⏺ Read(tasks.md)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

⏺ Update(tasks.md)
  ⎿  Updated tasks.md with 1 addition and 1 removal

       11      - Set up project structure: `src/messagedb_agent/` as main package

⏺ Update(tasks.md)
  ⎿  Updated tasks.md with 1 addition and 1 removal                              
       11      - Set up project structure: `src/messagedb_agent/` as main package

       17        - `src/messagedb_agent/events/` - event definitions

⏺ Update(tasks.md)
  ⎿  Updated tasks.md with 1 addition and 1 removal                                  
       22        - `src/messagedb_agent/engine/` - processing engine
       23        - `tests/` - test files mirroring src structure
       24

       27      - Add google-cloud-aiplatform for Vertex AI integration
       28      - Add structlog for structured logging

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully updated all Phase 1 tasks in tasks.md with their corresponding beads issue IDs:

  - Task 1.1: Initialize Python project with uv → messagedb-agent-1
  - Task 1.2: Define project structure → messagedb-agent-2
  - Task 1.3: Add core dependencies → messagedb-agent-3

  Now you can easily cross-reference between tasks.md and the beads issue tracker. Would you like me to continue with
   the remaining phases?

> yes continue with the reamining phases in tasks.md, create a beads issue for each task. the beads issue should 
include the task number (eg 2.3) from tasks.md, and also update tasks.md with the beads issue ID for full 
cross-referencing. remember to close the beads issue only if the corresponding task is completed in tasks.md. 

⏺ I'll continue with the remaining phases, creating beads issues for each task and updating tasks.md with
  cross-references. Let me start with Phase 2.

       67 +  - [x] **Task 2.4: Implement stream utilities** (`messagedb-agent-7`)
       68      - Created `src/messagedb_agent/store/stream.py` with three core functions:
       69        - `generate_thread_id()`: Generates unique UUID4 thread identifiers
       70        - `build_stream_name(category, version, thread_id)`: Builds stream names in format 
            `category:version-thread_id`

⏺ Good! Now let me continue with Phase 3. Let me read that section and create the beads issues:

⏺ Read(tasks.md)
  ⎿  Read 60 lines

⏺ Now let me create beads issues for Phase 3 tasks (all completed):

⏺ Due to the large number of tasks remaining, let me use the Task agent to help complete this work more efficiently:

⏺ Task(Create beads issues for remaining tasks)
  ⎿  Done (133 tool uses · 117.2k tokens · 6m 13s)                                                                  

⏺ Perfect! The task has been completed successfully. Here's what was accomplished:

  Complete Summary

  I've successfully integrated the entire tasks.md file with the beads issue tracker:

  Created Issues:

  - Total beads issues: 63 (messagedb-agent-1 through messagedb-agent-63)
  - Closed (completed): 33 tasks
  - Open (remaining): 30 tasks

  Phase Breakdown:

  - Phase 1 (Tasks 1.1-1.3): 3 issues - ALL CLOSED ✓
  - Phase 2 (Tasks 2.1-2.4): 4 issues - ALL CLOSED ✓
  - Phase 3 (Tasks 3.1-3.5): 5 issues - ALL CLOSED ✓
  - Phase 4 (Tasks 4.1-4.5): 5 issues - ALL CLOSED ✓
  - Phase 5 (Tasks 5.1-5.4): 4 issues - ALL CLOSED ✓
  - Phase 6 (Tasks 6.1-6.4): 4 issues - ALL CLOSED ✓
  - Phase 7 (Tasks 7.1-7.5): 5 issues - ALL CLOSED ✓
  - Phase 8 (Tasks 8.1-8.5): 5 issues - all OPEN
  - Phase 9 (Tasks 9.1-9.3): 3 issues - 1 CLOSED (9.2)
  - Phase 10 (Tasks 10.1-10.7): 7 issues - 1 CLOSED (10.2)
  - Phase 11 (Tasks 11.1-11.5): 5 issues - all OPEN
  - Phase 12 (Tasks 12.1-12.6): 6 issues - all OPEN
  - Phase 13 (Tasks 13.1-13.6): 6 issues - all OPEN

  Cross-Referencing:

  Every task in tasks.md now includes its beads issue ID in the format:
  - [x] **Task X.Y: Title** (`messagedb-agent-N`)

  You can now easily:
  - Reference beads issues from tasks.md using the issue ID
  - Track progress using /beads:list --status open to see remaining work
  - Use /beads:show messagedb-agent-N to see details of any specific task
